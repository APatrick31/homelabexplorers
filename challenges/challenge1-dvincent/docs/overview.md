## Skills Developed
- Docker container orchestration
- Reverse proxy configuration
- SSL certificate management
- Domain routing and networking
- Security best practices for web applications

## Challenge Structure
- Setup: Installing prerequisites and preparing the environment
- Deployment: Setting up Nginx Proxy Manager with Docker
- Configuration: Setting up proxy hosts and SSL certificates
- Testing: Verifying the functionality with multiple applications

## Expected Outcomes
- A functioning Nginx Proxy Manager instance
- Multiple applications accessible through different domain names
- Properly secured connections with valid SSL certificates
- A scalable infrastructure for hosting multiple web applications

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Docker and containers
